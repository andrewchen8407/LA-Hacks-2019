GOT FINANCE? is a desktop application made using Python's Tkinter library. Its primary audience is children who, at their schools, may have not been introduced to the sophisticated discipline of economics.

In order for the project to be run properly, authentication of credentials for the Google Cloud Platform's text-to-speech API must be made in the tts_gcp.py module. The driver.py module must be run to start the program, as that module contains the '__main__' block.
